# Challenge 10 SVG Logo Maker

## Description

This is a command line application that generates a professional SVG logo.  Logo's are an important piece of any business and graphic designers can be quite expensive.  This application allows an individual to design and generate a logo for free.  This project introduced me to SVG's and tests using Jest.

## Usage
Enter node index.js in the command line.  You will then be asked to enter 3 characters, the color of the text, to choose from 3 different shapes, and the color of the shape.  Once all questions are answered a SVG file is created with code for a logo based on your answers.
